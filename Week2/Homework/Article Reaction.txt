\f0\fs24 \cf0 I feel like the general idea of this article was that wireframes serve a few different purposes. First they allow you to get down on \'93paper\'94 the ideas you might have in your mind for what your site is going to look like, which allows others to input. Which ties in with the second purpose, collaboration and cooperation on the design to make sure individuals from all parts of the process are on board. It also seems to be a great way to highlight any potential errors early in the game so as to smooth out the coding process down the line. }
