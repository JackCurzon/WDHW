Separate the onion slices into rings, and place on a tray lined with parchment paper or silicone baking sheet. Place about 1 tablespoon of the guacamole mixture into each ring, depending on the size of the ring. Next, place the entire tray in the freezer for at least 1 hour or until the rings are frozen solid. <br/><br/>

Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Lightly oil a baking sheet or coat with nonstick spray.
<br/><br/>
Place flour in a medium bowl set aside. In another large bowl place pako breadcrumbs and set aside. lastly, in a medium bowl, whisk eggs and 2 tablespoons milk and set aside. 
<br/><br/>
Working in batches, dredge onion rings in flour mixture, dip into eggs, then dredge in Panko mixture, pressing to coat. Spread onion rings in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet; coat with nonstick spray or drizzle with olive oil. Place into oven and bake until golden brown and crispy, about 15-20 minutes. Serve immediately with chipotle sauce or your favorite dipping sauce. </p>
